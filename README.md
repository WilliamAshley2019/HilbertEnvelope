This is all I will likely do with this today :) Its improved a lot from this afternoon, still sort glitchy and in debug mode alpha. The sidechain mode is bugged still.

Concept use  TO OPEN YOUR MIND TO HILBERT!
Also as an Envelope Follower:
Track amplitude without phase issues
Create sidechain signals for compression
Generate control signals for other parameters

As a Creative Effect:
Add subtle amplitude modulation (tremolo-like)
Enhance transients on drums
Create rhythmic pumping effects
Sustain bass notes

As a Utility Tool:
Visualize amplitude envelopes in real-time
Detect peak levels with adjustable hold time
Generate phase-independent amplitude signals
